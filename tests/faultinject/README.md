# Fault injection: do the tests actually bite?

A green test tells you it passed. It does not tell you it would have gone red
had the code been wrong. A test that cannot fail is worse than no test, because
it reports safety it does not provide.

This directory breaks the code on purpose and checks the tests notice.

```sh
python tests/faultinject/run.py              # every target
python tests/faultinject/run.py xero_gate    # one target
python tests/faultinject/run.py --list       # what there is
```

Exit status is 0 only if every fault was applied, every fault turned its test
file red, and every control stayed green. A fault that *could not be applied*
is a failure too: an unmeasured claim and a false claim are the same thing to
whoever reads the result.

**Commit before you run it.** It edits real source files and restores them with
`git checkout --`, which discards uncommitted work. It refuses to start on a
dirty tree for that reason — that refusal is the most important line in here.

Nothing in this directory is named `test_*`, so pytest never collects it. The
ordinary suite cannot edit your source by accident.

## What is in here

| file | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `run.py` | runs the targets, reports, exits non-zero on anything unexpected |
| `harness.py` | apply an edit, prove it landed, run a test file, restore |
| `faults.py` | the faults: what to break, and which test file should notice |

`tests/offline/test_faultinject_harness.py` is part of the ordinary suite. It
reads and never writes, and it asserts every fault below still matches exactly
the one place it names — so a fault that has rotted is reported in the commit
that moved the code, not months later when somebody next runs this by hand.

## The three ways this goes wrong silently

Each guard exists because the mistake has actually been made in this repo, and
each turns a false pass into a hard stop.

1. **The edit matches nothing.** erplite is CRLF throughout, so a pattern
   written with `\n` matches zero times in every file. Six of the first twelve
   faults written for `test_xero_permission_gate.py` matched nothing for
   exactly this reason; without the match-count assertion they would have been
   reported as six passes. Write patterns with `\n` and let `harness.nl`
   translate them.
2. **The edit matches more than once**, lands somewhere unintended, and the red
   you get is not the red you asked for.
3. **Restoring destroys uncommitted work.** Hence the clean-tree refusal.

A fourth, which no guard can catch for you: **a negative control that goes red
is not a control.** It must change the source genuinely and change behaviour not
at all — a local variable rename, not a comment.

## Adding a target

For each claim the test file makes, ask: *what edit to the real source would
make that claim false?* Then write it as a `Fault` in `faults.py` and run it.

Three habits earn their keep:

* **Break the behaviour, not the spelling.** An edit that renames something the
  test matches by name proves only that the test reads that name.
* **Include a negative control.** Without one, "every fault went red" can just
  mean the test file fails at the slightest touch, which is not the same thing
  as biting.
* **Cover every instance of the rule, not a sample.** A gate on four DocTypes
  needs four faults. A test that notices two of them is guarding two — and you
  cannot find that out from a sample of two that both went red.

## Targets

### `xero_gate` — `tests/offline/test_xero_permission_gate.py`

Six `@frappe.whitelist()` endpoints write to the owner's real Xero ledger, and
are gated on each DocType's own permission rows (rev_c3343b2cf3). The contact
path also used to post to Xero and then save a document read before the post,
which could not succeed and duplicated the contact on the next attempt
(rev_6c9dc08cf7).

14 faults, 13 expected red and one control:

* the gate deleted, on each of the six endpoints in turn — one fault each,
  because Sales Invoice passing tells you nothing about Supplier;
* the gate present but useless: moved inside the `try`, where `except
  Exception` relabels a 403 refusal as a failed send; and `throw=False`. Both
  would pass a test that only looked for the call;
* the DocType JSON rows granting the unprivileged role `write`, and `create`
  without `write`. These are what prove the test enforces the shipped
  permission rows rather than a role list of its own — if it were hardcoded,
  granting the role access would change nothing;
* the duplicate-contact defect restored: the stale `save()` after the post, the
  already-sent guard removed, and the commit removed;
* **control:** a local variable rename in `customer.py`.

All 13 go red and the control stays green, against `main` at `9df2adc`.
